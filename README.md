# PyBer Analysis
Analysing total fares based on location type

### Overview
The main purpose of this analysis is to find the best compromise between the number of drivers and their average fares.  The PyBer data provided includes categorization of locations into urban, suburban and rural, the number of drivers per location, and fares per ride.

### Comparing the Areas
Although the total fares for urban rides are higher, the average fares per driver for urban rides are significantly lower.

This is likely due to the shorter ride time and length, plus the additional drivers available - in this analysis, there were 30x more driver in urban verus rural areas.

|Location|Total Drivers|
|-|-|
|Rural|78|
|Suburban|490|
|Urban|2405|

|Location|Avg Fare|
|-|-|
|Rural|$55.486|
|Suburban|$39.503|
|Urban|$16.571|

### Recommendations
One clear recommendation would be to increase the fares for urban locations.  This would increase the average fares for drivers.

One side effect of this action however may be the move of drivers from rural/suburban to urban locations due to the change of higher fares with less driving.

Another recommendation may be to increase marketing to drivers to encourage them to drive in rural or suburban areas.  Although total fares are lower in these areas, that is likely due to the shortage of drivers, since the average fare remains incredibly high.  While this would likely decrease the average fare in the short term, it would allow drivers to benefit from the higher average fare compared to urban areas, while also increasing the average fare in those urban areas due to fewer drivers.
